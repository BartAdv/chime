# Chime

A really lightweight Clojure scheduler.

## Usage

(to be expanded)

In summary - pass a (possibly infinite) list of Joda times (via clj-time if you want) and a function to chime/chime-at and (unlike Hollywood) it'll call you back. The function will be passed a single value - the time that the function was scheduled.
